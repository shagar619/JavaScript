# Questions about JavaScript

## üîπ What is JavaScript, and how does it differ from other programming languages like Java?

**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web applications. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside **HTML** and **CSS**, and is supported by all major browsers.

JavaScript enables developers to:

- Create dynamic web pages
- Handle events and user interactions
- Communicate with servers (e.g., using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`)
- Build web applications (frontend and backend via Node.js)
- Control multimedia and animations

It is **event-driven**, **asynchronous**, and **prototype-based**, making it very effective for building responsive user interfaces and single-page applications.

#### Key Features of JavaScript

- **Client-side execution**: Runs in the user's browser.
- **Interpreted**: No need for compilation.
- **Dynamically typed**: Variables do not require a fixed type.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal syntax and structure.
- **Asynchronous programming**: Uses Promises and async/await.
- **Object-oriented**: Uses prototype-based inheritance.

#### How Does JavaScript Differ From Java?

Although their names sound similar, JavaScript and Java are completely different languages with different purposes, syntax, and execution environments.

| Feature               | JavaScript                                              | Java                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Web development (client & server)                        | General-purpose application development                 |
| **Execution**         | Interpreted in the browser or Node.js                    | Compiled to bytecode and run on the JVM                 |
| **Typing**            | Dynamically typed                                        | Statically typed                                        |
| **Syntax**            | Flexible, minimal structure                              | Strict, verbose, strongly object-oriented               |
| **Object Orientation**| Prototype-based                                          | Class-based                                             |
| **Concurrency**       | Asynchronous (event loop, Promises, async/await)         | Multi-threaded (synchronization, concurrency models)    |
| **Platform Dependency**| Browser or Node.js                                     | JVM-based, cross-platform                               |

> **Note**: The similarity in names was a marketing strategy during the early days of JavaScript. JavaScript was originally called *LiveScript*, but was renamed to JavaScript to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.

#### When to Use JavaScript

JavaScript is ideal for:

- Interactive websites
- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
- Backend development (Node.js)
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Real-time applications (chats, games)

---

#### Conclusion

JavaScript is an essential tool in modern web development, enabling rich and interactive user experiences. While it shares part of its name with Java, the two languages serve different roles in software development. Understanding their differences helps developers choose the right tool for the right job.

## üîπWhat are the different data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has two main categories of data types: **Primitive** and **Non-Primitive (Reference)**.

---

#### 1. Primitive Data Types

These are the most basic data types and are stored by **value**.

| Type         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `String`     | Represents text. Example: `"Hello"` |
| `Number`     | Represents both integers and floats. Example: `42`, `3.14` |
| `Boolean`    | Logical `true` or `false` |
| `Null`       | Represents an intentional empty value |
| `Undefined`  | Declared but not assigned a value |
| `BigInt`     | Large integers beyond Number limit |
| `Symbol`     | Unique identifiers |

#### üî∏ Example Code:

```javascript
let name = "Alice";             // String
let age = 30;                   // Number
let isActive = true;            // Boolean
let salary = null;              // Null
let score;                      // Undefined
let bigNum = 123456789012345678901234567890n; // BigInt
let uniqueId = Symbol("id");    // Symbol
```

#### 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

These are more complex and stored by reference.

| Type         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `Object`     | A collection of key-value pairs |
| `Array`     | Ordered list of values |
| `Function`    | Reusable block of code |

#### üî∏ Example Code:   
```javascript
let person = { name: "Bob", age: 25 }; // Object
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]; // Array
let add = function(a, b) { return a + b; }; // Function
```


#### üîç Type Checking
Use `typeof` to check the data type of any value:

#### Example Code:

```
console.log(typeof "hello");      // "string"
console.log(typeof 42);           // "number"
console.log(typeof true);         // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined);    // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null);         // "object" (known JavaScript quirk)
console.log(typeof Symbol());     // "symbol"
console.log(typeof [1, 2, 3]);    // "object"
console.log(typeof function(){}); // "function"

```
